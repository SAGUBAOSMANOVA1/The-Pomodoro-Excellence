# Master of Times:Pomodoro Timer

This project is a simple web application that allows users to implement the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that involves breaking work into intervals. The application provides users with the ability to work for a set period of time, followed by short or long breaks.

## Code Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that constructs the user interface of the web application. Components such as the Pomodoro timer, control buttons, and task list are defined here.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the appearance of the page. Style properties such as colors, layout, and animations are defined here.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that manages the functionality of the application. Operations such as starting, stopping, resetting the Pomodoro timer, adding tasks, and marking tasks as completed are handled here.

## Explanation

- The Pomodoro timer tracks work for a specific duration and alerts the user when the time is up.
- Users can add tasks and mark them as completed when finished.
- As a browser-based application, it does not require any server and runs locally.
